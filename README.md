Welcome to my signal detection experiment repository

This project tests the signal detection capability of a participant using a LED and a buzzer. 
To run the experiment, you need to first upload the sketch to an arduino compatible board, I used an UNO
and then run the python script.
`python scripts/signal_detection_script.py`
